## 🚀 Usage Patterns

### For CMake Users:
```bash
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/run_assignment1.sh data/assignment1_input.txt
```

### For Make Users:
```bash
make all
make run1
```

### For VS Code Users:
1. Open project in VS Code
2. Cmd+Shift+B to build
3. F5 to debug
4. Or use Task Runner

### For Command Line:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./bin/assignment1
```

## 🔍 Verification Steps

To verify the restructuring:

1. ✅ Check directory structure exists
2. ✅ Verify source files are in `src/`
3. ✅ Verify headers are in `include/`
4. ✅ Verify scripts are executable
5. ✅ Check CMakeLists.txt is valid
6. ✅ Check VS Code configs are present
7. ✅ Verify .gitignore excludes build/
8. ✅ Check documentation is complete

## ⚠️ Prerequisites for Building

Before you can build, ensure:

- [ ] CUDA Toolkit installed (11.0+)
- [ ] CMake installed (3.18+)
- [ ] C++ compiler available (GCC/Clang/MSVC)
- [ ] NVIDIA GPU with drivers
- [ ] PATH includes CUDA binaries

See `SETUP.md` for detailed installation instructions.

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Install CUDA toolkit (see SETUP.md)
2. Run `./scripts/build.sh` to build
3. Run `./scripts/run_tests.sh` to test
4. Start developing with VS Code
5. Use profiling tools for optimization
